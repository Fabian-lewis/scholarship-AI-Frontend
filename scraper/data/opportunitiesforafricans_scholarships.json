Miles Morland set up the foundation which bears his name in 2013, after a career investing in Africa via two companies he created, Blakeney Management and DPI (Development Partners International).\n\nIt can be difficult for writers, before they become established, to write while simultaneously earning a living. To help meet this need the MMF annually awards a small number of Morland Writing Scholarships, with the aim being to allow each Scholar the time to produce the first draft of a completed book. The Scholarships are open to anyone writing in the English language who was born in Africa, or both of whose parents were born in Africa.\n\nScholars will receive a grant of £18,000, paid monthly over the course of twelve months. At the discretion of the Foundation, Scholars writing non-fiction, who require additional research time, could receive an additional grant, paid over a period of up to eighteen months.\n\nTo qualify for the Scholarship a candidate must submit an excerpt from a piece of work of between 2,000 – 5,000 words, written in English that has been published and offered for sale, you must send clear evidence that the piece you upload as part of your application has been both published AND offered for sale. Your submission will be evaluated by a panel of readers and judges set up by the MMF.\n\nThe work submitted will be judged purely on literary merit. It is not the purpose of the Scholarships to support academic or scientific research, or works of special interest such as religious or political writings.\n\nSubmissions or proposals of this nature do not qualify.\n\nThe only condition imposed on the Scholars during the year of their Scholarship is that they must write.\n\nThey will be asked to submit by email at least 10,000 new words every month until they have finished their book, or their Scholarship term has ended. If the first draft of the book is completed before the year is up, payments will continue while the Scholar edits and refines their work.\n\nSubmission Guideline:\n\nPlease tell us how you heard about the Morland Writing Scholarships.\n\nA submission of between 2,000 to 5,000 words as a Word document of work that has been published and offered for sale.\n\nProof of publication and proof of sale.\n\nA description of between 400 – 1,000 words about the new book you intend to write.\n\nA scan of an official document showing that you, or both of your parents, were born in Africa.\n\nA brief bio of between 200 – 300 words.\n\nFor More Information:\n\nVisit the Official Webpage of the Miles Morland Foundation Writing Scholarships\n\nConnecting Africans to the latest life changing Opportunities around the Globe.
